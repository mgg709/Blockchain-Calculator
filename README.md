# ðŸ§® Solidity Calculator Smart Contract

This repository contains a simple **Solidity-based calculator** that performs basic arithmetic operations on unsigned integers (`uint256`). The contract allows for **addition, subtraction, and multiplication** while also demonstrating **modifiers, events, and internal function logic**.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- âœ… **Addition**: Adds two numbers and emits an event.
- âœ… **Subtraction**: Subtracts two numbers and emits an event.
- âœ… **Multiplication**: Multiplies a stored `resultado` variable by a given number.
- âœ… **Modifier Usage**: `multiplier2()` requires the input number to be `10`, enforced via a custom modifier.
- âœ… **Event Emission**: Logs results of addition and subtraction operations.
